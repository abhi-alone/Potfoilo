# **Projects**

## Firmware Development of IoTifed Security Locker
- The scope of the device is to allow owners to monitor their security locker from virtually anywhere.
- The device uses Wi-Fi technology to connect the device with the cloud for remote monitoring and update locker state.
- And Bluetooth (BLE) to unlock the locker locally, thus acting as the key to the locker eliminating the need for a keypad or
traditional combination or keyed locks via Android/iOs mobile app.
- The mobile app also alerts users in the event of motion detection.
- I was involved in the designing, porting, and development of the Firmware for the Wi-Fi module.
- Also, I was involved in the device Homekit Certification.
## Firmware development of TEST EQUIPMENT for IoTifed Safety device
- The scope of this project to design and develop Test Equipment for the mass production of the devices.
- I was involved in designing and developing the GUI App to communicate with the host for flashing Z-Wave and STM
controller.
- Developed python-based Firmware on the Rasberry Pi to perform the device testing.
- I was involved in live debugging and support for client issues.
## Firmware development/upgradation of IoTifed Safety device
- The safety device is battery-operated devices having active Smoke/CO sensors to detect fire and CO into the premises
and alert the user to escape from the fire.
- The device has Z-Wave capabilities to send the alerts to the user over mobile applications via Z-Wave Gateway.
- Currently, working on debugging and solving the bugs in the current version of the Firmware.
- I got exposure to direct client communication and other project management and planning activities while working on
this project.
- Also guided three people technically on the Z-Wave.


## Platform Software development of Multi-core processor with Multi-core enabled Next Generation Avionics system
- The project has a scope of platform level development and verification of a display system for the helicopter.
- The system consists of the T20880 Quad-core Freescale processor and is designed to run such that every core of a quad-core processor is running a different type of RTOS (LynxOS and VxWorks 653) hosted by a hypervisor on SoC.
- Thus the system is Multi-core Multi-OS, one of its kind.
- I was involved in developing test cases and test procedures based on the DO-178C standard.
- Also was involved in the development/upgradation of the test framework in C/Trace 32.
